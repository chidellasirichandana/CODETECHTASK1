Overview of the Project

Project: Simple Calculator Program in Python
Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a simple command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It aims to provide an interactive, user-friendly experience while incorporating error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero.

Key Activities:
User Interaction: Prompting users to input two numbers and select a mathematical operation.
Arithmetic Operations: Performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user choice.
Input Validation: Handling invalid inputs and ensuring proper operation selection.
Error Handling: Preventing division by zero with appropriate error messaging.

Technologies Used:
Python: The primary programming language for implementing the calculator.
Standard Input/Output Functions: Using input() for user inputs and print() for displaying results.
