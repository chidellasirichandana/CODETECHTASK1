Overview of the Project

Project: Simple Calculator Program in Python
Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a simple command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It aims to provide an interactive, user-friendly experience while incorporating error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero.

Key Activities:

User Interaction:
Prompting users for inputs to enter two numbers and choose a desired operation.
Arithmetic Operations:
Implementing core mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Input Validation:
Ensuring numeric input and handling invalid operation choices gracefully.
Error Handling:
Preventing division by zero with a clear error message.

Technologies Used

Python: The primary programming language used for building the calculator logic and handling user input/output.
Standard Input/Output: Built-in functions like input() and print() for interacting with users.
